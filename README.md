# alpha-scorpii-api-chrome-extension

Extension for Google Chrome that periodically displays a question for you to answer. These questions are added by teachers who create them to help their students study for exams. As students answer the questions, a score is accumulated.

It's an old app that I created as a graduation project. It's not the best code in the world, but it's a pretty cool proposition.
